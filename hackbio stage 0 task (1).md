**Small molecules in cancer drug discovery**

Learning Track 1: Drug discovery

(Stage 0 Writing task)


Tumours are characterised by the abnormal growth of cells that escape normal physiological regulation, damaging healthy tissues and organs. The treatment of cancer faces several challenges due to its complex causes, the impact on normal tissues and organs, and the potential for relapse due to cancer stem cells and metastasis (1). Traditional cancer treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have been widely used, but their inability to differentiate between cancerous and normal cells leads to toxicity and side effects. So, scientists have shifted their focus towards targeted drugs, which can specifically target cancer cells while sparing normal ones, offering high potency with lower toxicity (2).

**Small Molecules in Cancer Treatment** 

One of the most promising targeted drugs is small molecules, which are low molecular weight organic compounds under 1000 Daltons. They play a crucial role in drug discovery and development, especially for cancer treatment. Their chemical structures can be synthesised and modified to optimise their biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties. Small molecules are stable, do not require specialised storage conditions, and are easier to handle compared to larger targeted proteins. They can be administered through various routes, including oral, intravenous, and topical, providing flexibility in treatment options (3).

**Real-World Applications of Small Molecules**

 Small molecules can selectively target specific proteins and pathways involved in cancer development and progression, such as kinases. 8 small molecule inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for various cancer treatments, highlighting their significance in oncology (5). Their targeted approach has transformed the treatment of certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with the development of imatinib (Gleevec).  Imatinib (Gleevec) is a small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Its introduction has transformed CML from a fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition, showcasing the effectiveness of targeted small-molecule therapies (6). Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) have been effective in targeting various pathways involved in cancer metastasis which were often considered resistant to traditional treatment. New small molecules in this category are being designed to improve efficacy and reduce side effects, particularly for solid tumours that have metastasized (7).

In conclusion, small molecules are crucial in cancer drug discovery, offering targeted and personalised approaches to combat the complexities of cancer at the molecular level. Their continued development, and advancements in our understanding of cancer biology, will be key to improving outcomes for cancer patients.
